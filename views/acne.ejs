        <h2 class="post-title">What is Acne?</h2>
        <div class="post">
            Acne is a skin disorder that occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells.
            This condition typically manifests as pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, cysts, or nodules.
            Although it is most prevalent during adolescence due to hormonal fluctuations, acne can affect people of all ages.

        <h2 class="post-title">Sources of Acne</h2>
        <div class="post">
            <h3>1.Hormonal Fluctuations</h3>
             During puberty, androgens stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce excess oil,
             leading to clogged pores and acne breakouts.
            <h3>2.Genetics</h3>
             Family history can play a role in acne development.
             If your parents had acne, you may have a higher risk of experiencing it too.
            <h3>3.Diet</h3>
             Certain foods, such as high-glycemic-index items and dairy,
             have been associated with increased acne severity in some individuals.
            <h3>4.Poor Skincare Habits</h3>
             Using harsh products, not cleansing regularly,
             or excessive scrubbing can irritate the skin and worsen acne.
            <h3>5.Stress</h3>
             Stress can trigger hormonal imbalances, leading to an increase in sebum production and acne flare-ups.

             Over-the-counter creams or gels containing ingredients like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or

            <h3>2.Prescription Medications</h3>

             Dermatological procedures, such as chemical peels, microdermabrasion, or laser therapy, can be effective in treating stubborn acne.

        <h2 class="post-title">How to Prevent Acne</h2>
        <div class="post">
            <h3>1.Maintain a Consistent Skincare Routine</h3>
             Cleanse your face twice daily with a mild cleanser and avoid harsh scrubs.
             Moisturize with a non-comedogenic product suitable for your skin type.

            <h3>2.Hands Off</h3>
             Avoid touching your face frequently, as it can transfer bacteria and exacerbate acne.

            <h3>3.Balanced Diet</h3>
             Consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while reducing high-sugar and high-dairy items.

            <h3>4.Manage Stress</h3>
             Engage in relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, or exercise to help reduce stress levels and minimize hormonal fluctuations.
